 - **The goals of research**
   - Enable a mobile robot to combine vision and olfaction information
   - Exploit semantic knowledge to smartly operate within human environments
 - **Project Overview**
   - Design and fabricate an artificial nose (e-nose) adapted to the requirements of a mobile robot
     - Measure gas concentrations 
     - Provide the type of gas
   - Gas classification and object recognition
     - Vision + olfaction for object recognition
   - Exploit Olfactory and Visual semantic information in odor source localization.
     - For example, a high concentration of gases related to rotten food suggest that somebody forgot about it.
     -  Semantic information can be exploited to automatically infer new robot tasks in order to maintain a set of pre-stablished human-like norms
  - **E-nose**
    - Multi-chamber electronic (MCE) nose
  - **Semantic-Based Autonomous Gas Source Localization**
    - Fuse classification results (vision + olfaction), a probabilistic Bayesian Framework is proposed to assign to each detected object a probaility of being the odor source. 
    - Then, a path planning algorithm based on Markov Decision Process (MDP) merges probabilities with the navigation distances from the current location to the different objects.
