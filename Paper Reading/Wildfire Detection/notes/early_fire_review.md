   * Traditional Wildfire detection can be categoried into **4** groups:
     * Sensor nodes
       * Humidity, Temperature, and Gases Sensors
       * *Advantages*: Low-cost, easy to implement
       * *Challenges*: deployment in remote areas, the obvious physical proximity of the nodes to fires, replace and retrieve non-functional nodes, against the law. 
     * UAV
       * *Pair with IoT devices*: In a fire event, the ground-based IoT devices in the vicinity of the wildfire generate alarms to the UAVs nearby, which then verify the fire probability to avoid misdetections. 
       * *Advantages*: Flexibility, provide high temporal and spatial resolution
       * *Challenges*: duration of flight
     * Camera Networks
     * Satellite surveillance
   * Wildfire Impact can be found in this paper
