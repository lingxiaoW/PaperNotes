- **Grounding**:
  - Grounded language has meaning in the context of the physical world - for example, by describing the environment, physical actions, or relationships between things. 
  - Grounded language acquisition is the process of learning these connections between percepts and actions. 
    - For example, if a person instructs a robot to pick up a cup, the robot must map the world "cup" to a particular set of percepts in its high-dimensional sensor space (e.g., camera obseravtion).

  - Grounding (from PaLM-E):
    - While training LLMs on massive textual data may lead to representations that relate to our physical world, connecting those representations to real-world visual and physical sensor modalities is essential to solving a wider range of grounded real-world problems in computer vision and robotics.
